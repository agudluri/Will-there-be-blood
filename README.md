## Introduction
Terrorism. The word carries such ghastly connotations that we immediately start thinking of beards, assault rifles, screams, pain and death. But what do we know about terrorism really? We do know of the atrocities committed and the global grief that ensues but do we know why they do what they do? Imagine there was a way to understand/analyze the various motives behind a terrorist attack with the help of real, tangible data. Imagine a world where you could predict an imminent threat to a city or nation. This project is a stepping stone to that shore.

## Objectives
* Can parameters like GDP, freedom and corruption scale of a nation help predict future terrorist attack zones?
* Can the number of casualties be predicted from our dataset-exclusive features?
* How prone is a happy country to terrorist attacks vs an unhappy or war-torn country?
* Where, geographically speaking, are terrorists most active?
* Can we even begin to fathom how their minds work based on other major factors like popular motives, attack types and such?

## The data
The data has been collected from an open source dataset called **The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)** that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd). It is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016. It includes systematic data on domestic as well as transnational and international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period. For each GTD incident, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties, and the group or individual responsible(when identifiable) and more.

Statistical information contained in the Global Terrorism Database is based on reports from a variety of open media sources. Information is not added to the GTD unless and until the sources are determined to be credible.
